The best part of my non-tech positions was always creating more effective
spreadsheet reports by scouring the Excel formula documentation. It did not take
long to dawn on me that I was programming (Excel is Turing complete!), and I
decided it was time to transition into a software engineering role.

For the past year, I've been enrolled in Flatiron School's full-stack web
development program. Along the way, I have been the recipient of several grants
and scholarships to attend programming conferences.
