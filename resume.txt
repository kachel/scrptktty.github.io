The best part of my non-tech positions was creating more effective spreadsheet reports by scouring
excel docs to construct the formulae. It did not take long to dawn on me that I was programming
(Excel is Turing complete!), and I decided to transition into an engineering role.

For the past year, I've been enrolled in Flatiron School's full-stack web development program.
Along the way, I have been the recipient of grants and scholarships to attend programming
conferences.
